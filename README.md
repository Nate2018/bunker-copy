## About
The classic bunker, rebuilt from the ground up with a more modern take on it's UI, and with many more features. Bunker allows you to privately browse the web and perform other actions without being seen by filtering and spying extensions. Bunker was originally built by [JavaScythe](https://github.com/JavaScythe) and [Cattn](https://github.com/Cattn).

## Features
**Hidden** - Bunker **_can't be seen_** by filtering extensions, and provides protection from anyone who may be trying to watch what you're doing.<br>
**Plugins** - Extend the default homescreen with plugins. These are essentially mini-apps that can be quickly accessed via the homescreen! <br>
**Apps** - Completely new addons to bunker, extending it's capabilities and built-in features! These can be installed through the Store, or individually.<br>
**Store** - An all-in-one source for activating bunker plugins and apps. You can add an external Store for even more apps not officially maintained!
